    '# What is a block?\n\nIn this Article\n## Think of Notion as a bottomless bin of building blocks. Build whatever you want, however you want! Every page you create in Notion will be composed of many "blocks," in the same way a LEGO castle is composed of many LEGO bricks üß±\n\nContents\n* Everything in Notion is a "block"\n* Blocks can transform\n* Blocks can be rearranged\n\n---',
    '## Everything in Notion is a "block"\n\nWhen you create your first page in Notion and begin typing, you\'ve started with a text block. But Notion pages can contain a lot more than plain text!\n\nImagine every piece of content you add to a page ‚Äî whether it\'s text, an image, or a table ‚Äî as a single building block. Every page is a stack of blocks combined however you want.\n\nHere\'s just one example page with different block types pointed out:\n\n**Tip:** Hit the\xa0`/`\xa0key on your keyboard (or tap the\xa0`+`\xa0button above your keyboard if you\'re on mobile) to see all the different types of content you can add.',
    '## Blocks can transform\n\nAny block in Notion can be turned into any other type of block in order to use, view, or deepen that information in a new way.\n\nTry this out by clicking the\xa0`‚ãÆ‚ãÆ`\xa0symbol and choosing\xa0`Turn into`\xa0to convert your block to something else!\n\n## Blocks can be rearranged\n\nThe\xa0`‚ãÆ‚ãÆ` button can be used to drag and drop existing blocks. This makes it simple to rearrange, reorder, and reshape your thoughts with one motion.',
    '# Create a page\n\nPlay\n\nIn this Article\n## Every page you create in Notion is a fresh canvas where you can add whatever content you want. Follow these steps to create your first one üìÑ\n\nContents\n* Create a page\n* Start writing\n* Try a slash command\n\n---\n\n## Create a page\n\nThere are a few ways to add a new page in Notion.\n\n* Click `üìù` at the top of your left sidebar.\n* If you‚Äôre on the desktop app, use the shortcut `cmd/ctrl` \\+ `N`.\n* If you‚Äôre on mobile, tap `üìù` at the bottom of your screen.\n\nNew page',
    '## Start writing\n\nOnce your new page opens, you can give your page a title and start jotting down your thoughts.\n\nNeed some inspiration or structure? On desktop or web, select any of the options at the bottom of the page to get started. You can import from an app or file, use a template, create a table, and more ‚Äî select an option you like, and your page will be formatted accordingly!\n\nAs you write, highlight any text on your page to bring up a menu of options.

    "## Try a slash command\n\nThe\xa0`/`\xa0command will quickly become your best friend in Notion.\n\n* Typing\xa0`/`\xa0brings up a comprehensive menu of block types \\- all of your content options. Experiment with different block types \\- you'll find your own personal favorite combinations!\n* Add any type of block by typing\xa0`/`\xa0and scrolling to the one you want or typing its name. For instance,\xa0`/h1`\xa0creates a large heading, and\xa0`/todo`\xa0creates a checkbox.",
    "# Create a subpage\n\nIn this Article\n## There are no folders in Notion. Instead, you can organize pages inside pages... inside pages. Here, we'll show you how to create a page within another page, which we call a subpage üìë\n\nContents\n* Create a subpage\n* Navigate with your sidebar and breadcrumbs\n* Rearrange your page structure\n\n---",
    '## Create a subpage\n\nA subpage is a page inside a page. You can create any number of subpages for a page.\n\nThere are multiple ways to create a subpage:\n\n* Open a page (this will be the subpage‚Äôs parent page) and use the slash command `/page`.\n* Find your desired parent page in your sidebar and select `+` next to it. This will create a subpage in that page. When you return to the parent page, you‚Äôll see the subpage there.\n\nOnce your new page opens, you can give your page a title and start jotting down your thoughts.\n\nNeed some inspiration or structure? On desktop or web, select any of the options at the bottom of the page to get started. You can import from an app or file, use a template, create a table, and more ‚Äî select an option you like, and your page will be formatted accordingly!',
    "## Navigate with your sidebar and breadcrumbs\n\nWhen you open the toggle for the parent page in your sidebar, you‚Äôll see its subpages there.\n\nAdditionally, at the top of your page, you‚Äôll see breadcrumbs that show you what page you‚Äôre in, and where that page lives.\n\n## Rearrange your page structure\n\nThe pages in your workspace can be easily rearranged.\n\n* To take a subpage out of its parent page, click on it in the sidebar and drag it out of the parent page's toggle.\n* To make a page a subpage, click on it in the sidebar and drag it into another page.",
    "# What is a database?\n\nIn this Article\n## Databases are a core feature in Notion that help you manage and organize your pages. Let's explain what they are and how they can help you level up your workspace üóÑ\n\nContents\n* Databases are collections of pages\n* Databases are pages themselves\n* Databases have properties\n* Database views display the same content in different ways\n\n---",
    '## Databases are collections of pages\n\nThink of Notion databases as filing cabinets or notebooks. Each database serves as a container, letting you easily organize multiple Notion pages in a single structure. In the screenshot below, every row of the table is a page within the database "Docs."\n\nThis gives you a birds\' eye view of an entire collection of pages at once. When you need to dive deeper, each page in a database can be opened, revealing its detailed contents.\n\n## Databases are pages themselves\n\nBut wait \\- each database is also a page itself! This is powerful, because it allows you to move and nest databases alongside other content, just like any other page.',
    '## Databases have properties\n\nTo help you organize all of the pages within a database, properties can be added to contextualize, label, and augment each individual item.\n\nYou can then search, filter, and sort by these property values.\n\n## Database views display the same content in different ways\n\nDatabases in Notion are not static. The set of pages within each database can be displayed in many different forms, or what we call views.\n\nIn addition to table view, the contents of a database can be visualized as a list, board, calendar, gallery, or timeline \\- whatever makes the information the most useful.',
    "# Create a database\n\nIn this Article\n## Now we'll create a database and use it to show off essential database actions and features. You'll get to play with database properties, views, filters, and sorts \\- let's get into it üìà\n\nContents\n* Create a new table\n* Add data to your table\n* Open a row as a page\n* Create new database views\n* Filter and sort your data\n\n---\n\n## Create a new table\n\n1. Add a new page and under `Get started with` and select `Table.`\n2. The first column is where you enter the name of your database pages. Each column in a Notion table corresponds to a property that gives your item context.\n3. Click a property heading, then `Edit property` and `Type` to see all of your property choices.",
    "## Add data to your table\n\nFor this example, we'll create a task database**.**\n\n1. Add some tasks you're working on in the `Name` column.\n2. Now add some values to the `Tags` column using the multi\\-select property. The options could be something like `P1`, `P2`, and `P3` to indicate the priority of a task.\n3. Add a new property using the `+` button to the right of the `Tags` heading.\n4. Change its name to `Due Date`. Click the property heading, then `Edit property` and `Type` and select `Date`. Now when you click on a cell under `Due Date`, you'll see the date picker.",
    '## Open a row as a page\n\nEvery item in a Notion database is also a whole page of its own! You can add any content you want inside, including other databases.\n\n1. To open a row as a page, hover over a cell in the `Name` column and click `OPEN`.\n2. You can add or edit any properties.\n\n* You can also add additional content into the body of the page.',
    "## Create new database views\n\nYou can create different views of the same data. Put it into a board, a calendar, a list, a gallery, or a timeline ‚Äî depending on your needs. Let's try one.\n\n1. Click `+` at the top of your table. Depending on your screen size, you may have to open the dropdown next to your current view and select `Add view`.\n2. Give your new view a name and choose `Board` from the right\\-side menu.\n3. This displays rows from your table into cards on a board, grouped by tag. Clicking on a card still opens it as a page. It's all the same content, just visualized in a different way!\n\nLearn more about views here ‚Üí\n\n**Tip:** Different views are good for different things, and you can have as many as you need!\n\n* Gallery view is great if you're storing images in your database.\n* Lists are helpful for minimalist storage of documentation.\n* Calendar view displays your pages by an assigned date property.\n* Timelines are useful for visualizing project dates and length.",
    "## Filter and sort your data\n\nFilter by property to focus on specific parts of your database.\n\n1. Click the filter icon at the top of your table, then select one of the default options or `+ Add advanced filter.`\n2. Then select the criteria that needs to be met. The middle dropdown will give you different options depending on the property.\n3. In this case, let's choose `Tags` as the property, and say it must contain `P1`.\n\nAdd sorts to reorder your database depending on property values. Sorts are helpful for quickly ordering your data by priority, date, tags, etc.\n\n* Click `‚áÖ` at the top of your table, then select the property you'd like to sort by.\n\n+ For example, choose `Due Date` and then `Ascending`. This reorders tasks from closest to furthest due date.\n\nYou'll see your database change in real time based on your filter and sort criteria. You can add as many filters and sorts as you want, and each view has its own filter and sorts.",

If in doubt, you can always check this list of\nSupported Functions\nor alphabetized\nSupport Table\nto determine which functions are supported.\n\nWhy can\'t I render a specific equation? What formulas/libraries do you support? Can you add support for a formula or library I want to use?\n\nNotion uses the\nKaTeX\nlibrary to render equations. KaTeX supports a large subset of LaTeX, documented on their list of\nSupported Functions\nand alphabetized in this\nSupport Table\n. To request support for new functions or environments, you can open an issue on the\nKaTeX GitHub project\n.\n\nI\'m trying to use the align environment and it\'s not working!\n\nFrom the\nCommon Issues\npage of the KaTeX documentation:\n\n"KaTeX does not support the\xa0`align`\xa0environment because LaTeX doesn\'t support\xa0`align`\xa0in math mode. The\xa0`aligned` environment offers the same functionality but in math mode, so use that instead."\n\nCan I use inline equations for superscript and subscript?\n\nIt\'s possible to use inline equations for superscript and subscript, but it does mean that the text will be an equation, in "equation font."\n\n* Use\xa0`^`\xa0to designate superscript, for example: `x^2`\n* Use `_` to designate subscript, for example: `H_2O`\n\nIf there are multiple characters that you want to include in superscript or subscript, wrap them in curly brackets. For example: `23^{rd}`\n\nWhat happens when I copy/paste inline LaTeX?\n\nIt will give you the source code.\n\nHow do I use Notion for chemistry?\n\nNotion supports the\xa0`\\\\ce`\xa0and\xa0`\\\\pu`\xa0chemical equation macros from the\nmhchem\nextension. These shortcuts allow you to typeset beautiful chemical and mathematical equations quickly and easily.\n\nHow do I convert between inline and block equations?\n\nIf you have a block containing an inline equation, you can use the "Turn into" menu to make it a block equation.\n\nStill have more questions?\nMessage support',

In this case, we've created a relation from the Customer database to the Items database, *and* a relation from the Items database to the Customer database.\n5. Click the blue\xa0`Add relation`\xa0button to finalize the creation of these two new relation properties.",
    "## View and remove related pages\n\nWhen you create a relation, you're essentially adding Notion pages stored in one database into the property field of another.\n\n* These pages can be opened and edited like any other! Click on the page in the relation column. Then click on it again in the window that pops up.\n* You can also remove any related page by hovering over and clicking the `‚Äì`\xa0at the right.\n\n* You can choose to limit the number of pages that can be included in your relations property ‚Äì with the option to select `1 page` or to have `No limit`.\n* If you select the option to limit it to `1 page`, people using your database will only be able to select 1 page in the relation. This is especially useful for situations where only one page should be related to one another, for example \\- if only one order number should be associated with each purchase.",
    '## Display options for relations\n\nRelations can be displayed on pages in three different ways.\n\nTo change the display:\n\n1. While on a database page, click on the relation.\n2. Click `Show as` and select one of the following:\n\n* `As property`: The relation will be displayed at the top of the page, alongside all the page properties.\n* `As page section`: The relation will be displayed right above the page body, as its own section. Best option if you want the relation to standout.\n* `Minimal`: The relation will be display right above the page body, but with the content hidden.\n\n**Note:** If you want to change a relation from `Minimal` to another display, click `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢` \\-\\> `Customize page`.',
    '### Customize displayed properties for relations\n\nWhen you set up a relation in your database, you can also choose to display certain properties of linked pages. For example, let‚Äôs say you have a database of frequently asked questions at your company. Each FAQ has a relation to a page that further explains the answer to the question. You might want people to also be able to see the owner of each page, so they know who to reach out to with more questions. You can set your FAQ database up so that the owner is visible along with the relevant page!\n\nTo do this:\n\n1. Open a page in a database that has a relation property.\n2. Click the field next to that property to link a page ‚Üí click `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢`.\n3. In the menu that appears, drag the properties of the related database into or out of `Shown in relation` or `Hidden in relation`.\n4. Once you‚Äôre done, you‚Äôll see your desired properties appear in the relation field. This will apply to all of the pages in your current database.',
    "## Relate a database to itself\n\nLet's say you want items in the same database to have relationships with each other. For example, you have a tasks database and you want each task to relate to other tasks.\n\n1. Start off by creating a new relation.\n2. Then search for and choose the database you're currently working in.\n3. You'll now see that the database is related to `This database`.\n\nJust as with relations between two databases, you can choose to make this a one\\-way relation or two\\-way relation.\n\n1. To make it a two\\-way relation, toggle on `Separate properties`. You'll see a second property show up.",
    "## Rollups\n\nRollups help you aggregate data in your databases based on relations. Going back to our customers and items example above, let's say you wanted to know how much each customer spent based on what they bought.\n\n1. First, create the relation so you know who bought what.\n2. Add a new column/property and choose\xa0`Rollup`\xa0from the\xa0`Property type`\xa0menu. Give it a descriptive name.\n\n* Clicking on any cell in the rollup column will bring up a new menu asking you for:\n\n+ The relation property you want to roll up.\n+ The property of those related pages you want to roll up.\n+ The calculation you want to apply to them.\n* So, for our example, you'd choose to roll up the relation property\xa0`Items Purchased`\xa0and the\xa0`Price` property within those pages. Then you'd choose\xa0`Sum`\xa0as the calculation.\n\n+ Doing this adds up the prices of each item related to a customer's name, giving you the total dollars they spent in your rollup column.",
    "### Rollup types\n\nThere are different calculations you can apply as a rollup. Here are all of them:\n\n* `Show original`: This just shows all related pages in the same cell. It's the same as the relation property itself.\n* `Show unique values`: This shows each unique value in the selected property for all related pages.\n* `Count all`: Counts the total number of values in the selected property for all related pages.\n* `Count values`: Counts the number of non\\-empty values in the selected property for all related pages.\n* `Count unique values`: Counts the number of unique values in the selected property for all related pages.\n* `Count empty`: Counts the number of related pages with an empty value for the property selected. So, if one item a customer bought didn't have a price and that was the property selected, the rollup column would say 1\\.\n* `Count not empty`: Counts the number of related pages with assigned values for the property you selected.\n* `Percent empty`: Shows the percentage of related pages with no value in the property you selected.\n* `Percent not empty`: Shows the percentage of related pages with a value in the property you selected.\n\n**These rollup calculations are only available for**\n**`Number`**\n**properties:**\n\n* `Sum`: Computes the sum of the numeric properties for related pages (like above).\n* `Average`: Computes the average of the numeric properties for related pages.\n* `Median`: Finds the median of the numeric properties for related pages.\n* `Min`: Finds the lowest number in the numeric property for related pages.\n* `Max`: Finds the highest number in the numeric property for related pages.\n* `Range`: Computes the range between the highest and lowest numbers in the numeric property for related pages (`Max` \\-\xa0`Min`).\n\n**These rollup calculations are only available for**\n**`Date`**\n**properties:**\n\n* `Earliest date`: Finds the earliest date/time in the date property for all related pages.\n* `Latest date`: Finds the latest date/time in the date property for all related pages.\n* `Date range`: Computes the span of time between the latest and earliest dates in the date property for related pages.",
    "### Aggregate rollups\n\nIn both tables and boards, you can apply calculations to your rollup column to get a sense of sums, ranges, averages, etc. for your entire database.\n\n* Let's say you want to find the total money spent by all customers in our example.\n* At the bottom of your Customers table, under your rollup column, click\xa0`Calculate`.\n* Choose\xa0`Sum`\xa0to add all the values in that column together and get a grand total.\n\n---",
    "## FAQs\n\nCan I export or import relations?\n\nWhen you export a relational database as a CSV file, the relation properties will export as plain text URLs. For now, you can't re\\-import that CSV back into Notion to re\\-establish the relations with other databases.\n\nCan I duplicate a database with a relation?\n\nYes, but the following will happen which can be kind of confusing:\n\nIf you create a copy of the Customers database in the example above, you'll see a new relation property automatically appear in the Items database.\n\nThis happens because relations sync two ways in Notion. When a database is duplicated, you also duplicate its relationships with other databases. You'll get the hang of it! üí™\n\nCan I rollup a rollup?\n\nUnfortunately not, as this could create unintended loops. We recommend sticking to rolling up other properties\xa0üòä\n\nStill have more questions?\nMessage support",

Automations consist of both triggers (the events that initiate the automation) and actions (the effect of the automation). Database automations are meant to help save you time and simplify your work, and can be very basic or more complex depending on your needs.\n\nDatabase automations can be used for many things, including:\n\n* Assigning a task to a specific person when its status changes.\n* Sending a Slack notification to a channel when a page is added to a database.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* **Database automations are available on paid plans on all platforms.** Free plan users can create Slack notification automations and use, but not edit, existing automations in templates.\n* **Database automations can be created, edited, or deleted by anyone with full access to the database.**\nSlack automations\nare the only exception.

    '## Database automation triggers\n\nAutomations can have one trigger or multiple triggers. When you set up an automation, you can decide whether the automation will take place `When any of these occur` or `When all of these occur`.\n\n**Note:** If you have multiple `is edited` triggers that must **all** occur for your automation to take place, those triggers need to happen within a small window of about three seconds. If they don‚Äôt, your automation may not be triggered properly. To avoid this, you can:\n\n* Create separate automations for each trigger.\n* Use a more specific trigger than `is edited`, like `is set to` or `contains`.\n\nYou can choose from two types of triggers: `Page added` or `Property edited`.\n\nIf you choose a `Property edited` trigger, you can indicate which properties from your database will trigger the automation.\n\nFor name, person, number, text, select, and relation properties, you can choose what kinds of edits made to that property will trigger an automation. For example, you might have a list of contacts in a Notion database and set up an automation where the trigger is a phone number starting with the numbers 732, and the action is that person‚Äôs state being set to New Jersey.\n\nYou can also have more than one condition for your trigger so that two or more things must be true for the automation to occur.',

You can put them in the next sprint, move them to your backlog, or keep them in their original sprint.\n* `Automated sprints`: Turn this on if you want sprints to complete automatically before the next one is automatically created and started.\n* `Turn off sprints`: Choose this to turn off a sprint. Once you turn sprints off, your sprints database, sprint board, and relations between tasks and sprints will be permanently deleted. If you choose to turn sprints on again, you‚Äôll start with a brand new database, board, and relations.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* You can‚Äôt adjust the dates in your sprints database because these dates are either populated based on the settings above, or set when you manually complete a sprint.\n* If you need to break your sprint cadence temporarily, like for the holidays, we suggest turning off automatic sprints and waiting until you‚Äôre ready to resume your normal sprint cadence before starting your next sprint.\n\n**Learn more**\n\n* How engineering and product teams use Notion for sprint planning\n* Connect projects and docs to get more done, faster",

If your databases aren‚Äôt feeling very fast when you use them, there are a few reasons why this might be happening, and a few ways you can make improvements.',
    '## Things that can slow your database down\n\n* Number of pages: If your database has a ton of pages, it might be slower to load.\n* Number of properties: The more visible properties your database has, the longer it might take to load.\n* Complex sorts and filters: If your database has a sort or filter on properties like title, text, formula, or rollup, the logic behind it can make load times longer.\n\n## Things you can do to speed up your database setup',
    '### Avoid building too many databases into high\\-traffic pages\n\nIf you have a large workspace, avoid having lots of\ninline databases\n, like dashboards, in high\\-traffic pages. The more simultaneously viewed databases, the more stress on your setup.\n\nTry housing each database in its own page first. Once you‚Äôve done that, if you‚Äôd like all of the databases to be displayed in one page, you can:\n\n1. Type `/linked` in that page and select `Linked view of a database` to create a\nlinked database\n.\n2. Create database views in this linked database and configure them to point to your desired source databases. Different database views can point to different source databases!\n\nWhen using a single linked database, only one database view is open at a time, and therefore only that one database is listening for updates. You should see an improvement in performance with this setup.',
    '### Avoid complex reference chains\n\nFormulas and rollups are extremely powerful, but the more complex they are, the slower your database may be. For example, a formula that depends on several other formulas that each depend on rollups may take longer to calculate.\n\n### Minimize the number of filters and sorts on formulas and rollups\n\nDatabases that are\nfiltered and sorted\non\nformula\nand\nrollup\nproperties may take a bit longer to load.\n\n### Filter on simple properties\n\nAdding filters based on simple properties such as select, multi\\-select, status, number, and date may improve the speed of your database. Even if you have complex filters, this may help by reducing the number of pages that need to be processed.',
    "### Hide unnecessary properties\n\nIf some properties are less important in your database view, hiding them may improve responsiveness and interactivity.\n\n### Delete any unused pages\n\nWe suggest removing any unnecessary or duplicative pages from your database to keep it as simple and up\\-to\\-date as possible. If that‚Äôs not an option for you, adding a filter on the `Created time` property to filter out old pages may significantly improve performance for very large databases.\n\n**Learn more about databases to make sure you're using them in the best way for your specific needs**\n\n* Organize information with databases\n* More resources on databases",

If you want some pages to not be visible to certain people, then we recommend disabling it. You can always grant some groups or individuals more access.\n\nHow can groups be used instead of multiple separate workspaces?\n\nWe've seen people create multiple workspaces instead of groups to set granular permissions. For instance, they create separate workspaces for Design, Marketing, and their executive team so these groups can't access, edit, or get distracted by each other's work. There's a quick workaround for this using groups:\n\n* Disable\xa0`Workspace access`. That way pages won't show for people and groups who aren't specifically granted access.\n* On every page,\xa0grant different levels of access per group. Those access levels will hold true for all the sub\\-pages on that page.\n* So, for example, you could have a section of your workspace just for the engineering team. Create a group of all your engineers, then on the top\\-level page for that team, turn on\xa0`Full access`\xa0for only that group. Nest pages inside that page, and only the engineering team can access them, too!\n\nCan I create a shared private page using groups?\n\nYes. If you create a page in the\xa0`Private`\xa0section of your sidebar, you can go to\xa0`Share`\xa0and toggle on access for a group inside your workspace. Choose their access level like you would on any other page. You'll see the page automatically move to the\xa0`Shared`\xa0section of your sidebar. Only you and the members of that group will be able to see it.\n\nHow can I allow members in my workspace to request guests for approval?\n\nAs a workspace owner, you can disable guests for your workspace in your\nworkspace security settings\n, but still allow members to send guest invite requests for review by the workspace owners. This provides a standardized way for guests to get access to content within your workspace, without being an all or nothing approach.\n\nStill have more questions?\nMessage support",

Any member on any plan can take advantage of the Asana importer.\n\n**Importing from Asana vs. syncing Asana with Notion**\n\nImporting your Asana data into Notion is best if you want to move from Asana and use Notion as the primary tool for your work. The data will be duplicated into Notion, but not synchronized with Asana.\n\nSynced databases\nallow you to connect Asana to Notion without importing any data. You might prefer to use synced databases if you use both Asana and Notion for your work. Synced databases only go one direction, meaning that changes will need to happen in Asana in order for updates to reflect in Notion.\n\nTo add a synced database from Asana, simply paste a project link right into a Notion page.

    "## Import from Asana into Notion\n\n**Note:**\n\n* To import your Asana projects to Notion, you must be associated with a team in Asana, even if you're the only person on that team.\n* You can only import one Asana workspace into Notion at a time.\n* Each Asana team will be imported into one Notion teamspace.\n* Multiple projects imported into one teamspace will go into the same Projects and Tasks databases. If you'd like to import into multiple databases, try importing in batches.\n* In the import process, there will be some default properties that you‚Äôll be required to import into Notion from Asana.\n\nTo import from Asana into Notion:\n\n1. Go to `Settings` in your sidebar ‚Üí `Import` ‚Üí `Asana`. Alternatively, use the `/` command `/asana` in a page and select the option under `Import`.\n2. Sign into Asana and grant the requested permissions.\n3. Under `Choose Asana workspace`, select the Asana workspace you want to import.\n4. Select the projects you‚Äôd like to import.\n5. Select the Notion teamspace your projects should be imported into. Each Asana team will be imported into one Notion teamspace.\n6. You can check the box next to your workspace name to `Exclude completed projects` or `Select all projects`.\n7. Select `Next`.\n8. By default, all Asana task properties will be imported into Notion, but you can customize this per teamspace. Choose to `Select all properties` (the default setting) or `Customize properties`. Note that there are default properties that must be imported.\n9. Choose whether the `Status` property in Notion should be mapped to your `Section` or `Completed` property in Asana.\n10. Select `Import`.",
    '## How importing from Asana works\n\nYour selected Asana projects and properties will be imported along with the tasks associated with those selected projects. Asana projects and tasks will be imported into Projects and Tasks databases in Notion, respectively. The Notion Projects and Tasks databases are related to each other, in line with our\nProjects \\& Tasks template\n.\n\nYour Projects and Tasks databases come with several views to help you see and track your work more easily. Visit the links below to learn about:\n\n* Databases\n* Views, filters, and sorts\n* Table view\n, which is the **equivalent of Asana‚Äôs list view**\n* List view\n* Timeline view\n* Board view\n* Calendar view',
    '### How Asana maps to Notion\n\n* Asana projects will become Notion projects.\n* Asana tasks will become Notion tasks.\n* Asana teams will become Notion teamspaces.\n* Asana organizations or workspaces will become Notion workspaces.',
    '## Projects database\n\nYour Asana projects will be imported into a Projects database in Notion. The Asana importer will pre\\-populate default database views for ease of use. You can add or delete views and properties as needed.\n\nThese default database views include:\n\n* Active (table view): This view shows the projects you‚Äôve imported whose status is to\\-do or in progress. In other words, this view doesn‚Äôt show projects that have already been completed. There are also preset filters for owner and date to make searching easier.\n* Timeline view: This view displays project name, status, owner, and completion rate. There are also preset filters for status, owner, and date to make searching easier.\n* Board view: This view shows your projects grouped by status (`Planning`, `Backlog`, `On Track`). You can customize the statuses that show in the view in the `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢` menu. Projects are sorted by descending priority.\n* All (table view): This view displays all of your imported projects. There are preset filters for status, owner, and date to make searching easier.\n\n**View project details**\n\n* In each project page, you can find the project description from Asana in the toggle at the top.\n* Below the project description, you‚Äôll see multiple views of the tasks related to that project. All views are filtered by the project you‚Äôre in.\n\n+ Board view: This view is grouped by status and sorted by descending priority.\n+ Task (table view): This view is grouped by status (if the status group is empty, it will be hidden).\n+ Timeline view: This view displays task name, assignee, and status.\n+ Calendar view: This view shows your tasks by date and displays assignee and status.',
    '## Tasks database\n\nYour Asana tasks will be imported into a Tasks database in Notion. As with the projects database, the Asana importer will pre\\-populate database views for ease of use. You can add or delete views and properties as needed.\n\nThese default database views include:\n\n* By Project (table view): This view shows all tasks, grouped by project.\n* Board view: This view displays your tasks, grouped by status and sorted by descending priority. There are pre\\-set filters for assignee and due date.\n* All tasks (table view): This view shows you all of your imported tasks.\n* Mine (table view): This view is filtered to only show tasks that are assigned to you.\n* Calendar view: This view shows your tasks by date and displays assignee and status.',
    '## Import logs\n\nWhen your import completes, you will receive an import log in the private section of your sidebar. In this log you will find a summary of your import, including the Notion teamspace that your Asana projects and tasks were imported into.\n\n---',
    '## FAQs\n\nHow are the Task assignees imported if that assignee is not present in Notion?\n\nIf the Tasks assignees imported do not have a Notion, the user would be added as a placeholder to the workspace.\n\nThese placeholder accounts will attribute comments and mentions. If and when these users sign up, they will be mapped to the corresponding placeholder account, and comments and mentions will be attributed to the correct user.\n\nHow long does it take for the Asana Importer tool to import a large number of tasks?\n\nImport times may range from a few minutes to several hours depending up on the size of the import. You will receive an email notification once the import is complete.\n\nIs there a limit to the number of tasks that can be imported at once?\n\nThere are no hard limits on number of tasks that can be imported, but we recommend limiting imports to 20K tasks per teamspace.\n\nHow are subtasks imported?\n\nThey are imported as subtasks (along with dependencies) that are within the same database.\n\nDo updates I make in my Asana account automatically get updated in Notion?\n\nNo, the import is a one\\-time action.\n\nWe do not maintain a connection with your Asana account and any changes you make in your Asana account after the import **will not** automatically update in Notion.\n\nIs there a way to preview the import before they are added? Can I undo an import?\n\nThere is no way to preview or undo, but during the process you will select which specific projects you wish to import.\n\nIn addition you can easily delete specific projects or tasks within Notion. You can even delete the entire database and start over.\n\nStill have more questions?\nMessage support',

There is currently no way to see all database notification workflows in your workspace from one central place.\n\nPersonal @\\-mention notifications can be managed from `Settings and members` ‚Üí `My notifications & settings`\n\nWhen one person connects Notion to Slack, does that turn it on for everyone?\n\nNo, when one user sets up the integration all Slack users will be able to see an unfurled Notion page link or a Slack link preview in Notion.\n\nBut to use the functionality themselves, other users have to connect Slack individually.\n\nHow do I send Slack messages to a specific database view?\n\nThe easiest way to send a Slack message to a specific database view (e.g. you might have a view for only your team‚Äôs tasks), is to copy the link to the database view and paste that link into the send to Notion prompt in Slack.\n\nWhen you send a Slack message to a specific database view, the properties are auto\\-filled for you. No need to update them yourself manually!\n\nDoes the @\\-mentioned notification in Slack work when a user is mentioned as part of a group @\\-mention in Notion?\n\nYes. A group mention in Notion will trigger the @mention notification in Slack to all members of the Notion group that have the Slack @mention turned on.\n\nAre there other 3rd party integrations providers and can I continue to use them (e.g. Zapier)?\n\nYes those integrations will continue to work as before\n\nWill this new integration impact how I currently use Slack link previews?\n\nSlack link previews will continue to exist and work normally.\n\nIf you'd like to use the new features (send messages to Notion, notifications in Slack, and expandable links) you'll need to re\\-install the Slack integration\nhere\n\nStill have more questions?\nMessage support",

First `Select projects to sync`, then `Select properties to sync`.\n\nRepeat the steps above if you‚Äôd like to set up another Jira sync for another site, teamspace, or workspace. Comments and attachments (up to five files per issue, no larger than 1MB) will also be synced.\n\nYou can\napply permissions\nto the database page to make the synced databases accessible to your collaborators.\n\n**Note:** Jira synced databases will inherit Notion permissions. **Members can access synced databases on any pages they have permission to view.**\n\nIf a member adds a private Jira project to a Notion page, anyone with Notion page access will see it.',
    "### People property in your synced database\n\nSynced databases will include people properties! Now, you can use identity mapping to connect third party JIRA identities to your team's Notion profiles. To do this:\n\n1. Confirm you have implemented Jira Cloud.\n2. If you‚Äôre an admin, go to Jira, click on `Jira System settings,` and change the user email visibility from `Hidden` to `Public` inside your organization.

This database will come with pre\\-populated default database views to help you get started more quickly:\n\n* Active (table view): This view shows the projects you‚Äôve synced whose status is in progress. In other words, this view doesn‚Äôt show projects that have already been completed. There are also preset filters for owner and date to make searching easier.\n* Timeline view: This view displays project name, status, owner, and completion rate. There are also preset filters for status, owner, and date to make searching easier.\n* Board view: This view shows your projects grouped by status (`Planning`, `In Progress`).

    '### Issues database\n\nYour Jira issues (epic, bug, task, subtask, story) will be synced into a Notion issues database, the equivalent of a Notion\ntasks database\n. As with the synced projects database, there will be default database views created for you to help you get started more quickly:\n\n* By Project (table view): This view shows all tasks, grouped by project. There are pre\\-set filters for status, assignee, date, and project to make searching easier.\n* By Epic (table view): This view shows your Jira stories, tasks, and bugs grouped by Epic.\n* Board view: This view is grouped by status and sorted by descending priority.

    '## Sync duration and limitations\n\n* It should only take a few minutes for the initial sync to complete, but depending on the size of your Jira projects and issues, this could take up to a few hours.\n* Some issue fields or properties may not sync, such as rich text in property and nested multi\\-selects.\n* Once the initial sync has been set up, updates to properties should be reflected in Notion in real time. If you create new properties, it could take up to 12 hours for those changes to sync.\n* You can‚Äôt manually sync Jira with Notion ‚Äî syncs happen in response to updates made in Jira.\n* At this time, updates from Jira will sync to your Notion database in real time ‚Äî not the other way around.

If instead you see a **yellow** `Sync failed` or `Sync stopped`, you may have to follow\nthe steps below\nto reconnect Jira.\n* Make sure you have edit access or full access to a synced database if you want to add or remove projects or properties.\n* If you‚Äôre not seeing updates on the Notion side, try refreshing the page.\n* The `Watcher` property can take up to 12 hours to sync properly.\n\n**Note:** If you delete a property in Jira, the associated database item in your synced database will be deleted too.',
    '## Reconnect your synced database\n\nIf your webhook registration has failed, or your project sync has failed, you‚Äôll see `Sync failed` at the top of the database. To solve this issue, try the sync again with a different set of projects. You can also ensure that your projects don‚Äôt have any issues in Jira.\n\nIf your Jira token is no longer valid or someone has disconnected Jira from Notion, you‚Äôll see `Sync stopped` at the top of the database. To solve this issue, select `Re-authenticate` next to `Sync stopped`. You must be a workspace owner to complete this process.\n\nOnce your Jira instance is reconnected with Notion, your projects and issues databases won‚Äôt be recreated; instead, you‚Äôll continue to use the projects and issues databases you had before.',

    '## Notion billing basics',
    "### You're billed per member\n\nNotion uses a billing model that charges you based on the number of seats, or licenses, you are using in your workspace. One seat is assigned to each member (not guest) in your workspace. This billing model gives you the flexibility to change which specific people join your Notion workspace as a member, without accruing new charges every time you add a new user.\n\nHere‚Äôs an example:\n\n* Your team is working with three contractors, who have been added as members to your Notion instance. When their contracts are finished, you remove them from your Notion workspace.\n* Until the end of your billing period (monthly or annual), you will still have three paid seats in Notion that you can instead fill with new contractors, new hires, interns, or anyone else who you might want to add to your workspace as a member.\n\nLearn more about workspace members and how to manage them\nhere ‚Üí\n\nWhen you **add** members to your workspace:\n\n* Regardless of whether you're paying yearly or monthly, our system reviews how many members you've added and issues invoices on a monthly basis.\n* You only pay for the fraction of the billing interval that a member belonged to your workspace.\n* Because you pay at the beginning of every billing interval, these charges for changes made in the middle of a billing interval are added retroactively to your next invoice.\n* **On a monthly plan,** this means you get your regular monthly invoice billing you for the month ahead (including new members), but the invoice will also include retroactive prorated charges for the members you added during your last billing interval.\n\n* **On a yearly plan**, this means you'll receive an invoice at the **next month** mark (on the same calendar date you bought your plan) that will include two things:\n\n+ The amount due for each new member for the remainder of your year\\-long plan.\n+ Retroactive charges for those new members prorated based on the amount of time they've belonged to your workspace.\n\nWhen you **remove** members from your workspace:\n\n* After removing members, **you will still have access to any existing paid seats until the end of your billing interval. You can add new members to fill these seats at no additional charge.**\n* When your billing interval ends, we will recalculate the total number of paid seats in use in your workspace and bill you accordingly.\n\nGo to `Settings` in your sidebar ‚Üí `People` to view how many paid seats your workspace has, how many members are currently in your workspace, and when you'll be billed next. You can easily manage the members in your workspace here.",
    "### We bill you upfront\n\nYou always pay for Notion at the start of your billing interval. If you make changes in the middle of a billing interval, we'll prorate how much you're charged, so that you only pay for what you actually used. These prorations will be applied at the start of the next billing interval.",
    "### Every workspace is billed separately\n\nYou can create multiple workspaces per account (in other words, per email address you signed up with), in which case you'd receive multiple bills. This is why you might see multiple charges for Notion even if you have only one account.\n\n* If you have multiple workspaces, you'll be billed based on how many members you have in each (on a Plus, Business, or Enterprise Plan).\n* Even if the same people are in multiple workspaces, you'll be charged for them in each one.",
    '### Your billing interval is set at the workspace level\n\nYou could have one workspace billed annually and one billed monthly. You pay less when you choose annual billing. Everyone who joins your workspace will add an additional charge based on the interval of that workspace.',
    '## Yearly vs. monthly billing\n\nYou can choose to pay for Notion on a yearly or monthly basis. This impacts both how much you pay and when you pay.\n\n* Yearly billing costs less.\n* Your plan renews automatically either once a year or once a month.\n\n+ If you pay yearly, your plan will renew on the same calendar day you first purchased it for all following years.\n+ If you pay monthly, the same is true of each following month.\n+ For example, a yearly plan bought on May 3 will renew May 3 the next year, and a monthly plan renews June 3\\.\n* **Your bill adjusts for your paid seat count either once a year or once a month.**\n\n+ If you pay yearly, the number of licenses you are paying for will be recalculated and reflected in your billing **once a year**, on the same calendar date as when you first purchased Notion.\n+ This is the only time during the year when your billing will change to reflect any paid seats that have been removed from your workspace.\n+ If you pay monthly, this recalculation will occur **once a month** on the same calendar date. Your billing will reflect any paid seats that have been removed from your workspace.\n+ When your plan renews, you will only be billed for the number of members currently in the workspace. This means your bill will go down if you have removed members since your last bill, and it will go up if you have added members since your last bill.\n\nIf you expect your team size to fluctuate often, or you‚Äôd like more control over your budget, we recommend a monthly billing interval.',
    "## See your plan and billing details\n\n**Note:** Only workspace owners can view and manage plans and billing.\n\nTo view the details of your plan and your billing information:\n\n1. Go to `Settings` in your sidebar.\n2. Click `Billing` in the sidebar of the pop\\-up window.\n3. At the top, you'll see which plan you're on, how much you're paying for it either yearly or monthly, and the date it will renew.\n\n## Changing your billing interval\n\nTo change your billing interval:\n\n1. Go to `Settings` in your sidebar.\n2. Click `Billing` in the sidebar of the window that pops up.\n3. Click `Update` next to your current billing interval and choose what you want.",
    "### Change from monthly to yearly\n\n**When you change from monthly to yearly**, you'll establish a new billing cycle, with your plan automatically renewing on the calendar day you made this change the next year.\n\nWhatever amount of time is left on your already paid monthly cycle will be subtracted from your annual payment.\n\nFor example:\n\n* Let's say you‚Äôre on the Plus Plan, billed monthly.\n* By April 15, you love Notion so much that you switch to a yearly billing interval.\n* You already paid for part of the month, so we prorate the price of your yearly plan.\n* Since half the month went by, we remove the unused time (the latter half of the month) from your yearly price.",
    '### Change from yearly to monthly\n\n**When you change from yearly to monthly**, the new monthly billing cycle will take effect the day your annual cycle ends. Your plan will automatically renew each month on the same calendar day going forward.\n\n## View your upcoming invoice\n\nTo view your upcoming invoice:\n\n1. Go to `Settings` in your sidebar.\n2. Select `Billing`.\n3. Under `Invoices`, select `View invoice`.',
    "## Understanding your invoice\n\nYour invoice might look different from what you expect, and this could be for several reasons:\n\n* You've added or subtracted members from your workspace during the billing interval. Note that when you add new members to your yearly Plus, Business, or Enterprise Plan, you'll be charged for **an entire year** of Notion for each of them.\n* You changed your billing interval from monthly to yearly, or vice versa.\n* You upgraded your plan during a billing interval. In this case, we charge you your previous rate for the time you had that plan, and your new rate for the time you had your upgraded plan. It's a blend of both!\n* You've applied credits to your balance due.",
    "## Payment methods\n\nOn Notion for web, you can pay for your plan with a debit or credit card, or Apple Pay.

    "## FAQs\n\nWhy aren't I getting emailed invoices?\n\nWe don't send email invoices at this time, but you can download a PDF version by going to the `Billing` tab in `Settings`.\n\nDoes Notion offer startup discounts?\n\nYes! Startups can apply to get up to 6 months free, including unlimited AI.\nLearn more and apply here!\n\nCan I pay with PayPal or Alipay?\n\nAt this time, we don't support payments using PayPal or Alipay.\n\nMy paid workspace just got downgraded to a free plan. What happened?\n\nYou may have an unpaid invoice on your account ‚Äî our system will automatically downgrade a paid account after several attempts are made to collect payment.\n\nThat said, you can re\\-upgrade via the `Upgrade` tab in `Settings` and settle your unpaid invoices from there. Send us a message if you need help!\n\nI just upgraded to a paid plan, but one of my workspaces still says it's on a free plan.\n\nPlans only apply to a single workspace and don't cover your whole account. We recommend using the fewest workspaces possible, and taking advantage of top\\-level pages in your sidebar to stay organized.\nMore on that here\n.\n\nHow can I avoid needing multiple workspaces?\n\nWe've seen people create multiple workspace instead of groups to set granular permissions. For instance, they create separate workspaces for Design, Marketing, their executive team, etc. so they can't access, edit, or get distracted by each other's work. You don't need to do this. Instead:\n\n* Disable `Workspace Access`. That way pages won't show for people and groups who aren't specifically granted access.\n* On every page,\ngrant different levels of access per group\n. Those access levels will hold true for all the sub\\-pages on that page.\n* So, for example, you could have a section of your workspace just for the engineering team. Create a group of all your engineers, then on the top\\-level page for that team, turn on `Full Access` for only that group. Nest pages inside that page, and only the engineering team can access them, too!\n\nHow can I update my invoices to include my billing address and/or VAT number?\n\nWe can update this info for you! Just message us in the app by clicking the Notion AI face at the bottom right on the desktop app (or in your sidebar on mobile), or email us at\nteam@makenotion.com\n.",

    '## FAQs\n\nWhy is the current Enable SAML SSO greyed out?\n\nThe most common reason is that you have not yet verified ownership of a domain. If this is the case, you will notice that you either don‚Äôt have any domains listed in the verify email domain section or the domain is pending verification.\n\nFor next steps,\nrefer to our instructions on how to complete domain verification here ‚Üí\n\nWhy can‚Äôt I edit the SAML SSO settings?\n\nThe most common reason is that you are trying to modify the verified domains or SSO configuration from a linked workspace which is a workspace that is already associated with another SSO configuration.\n\nIn linked workspaces, all domain management and SSO configuration settings are read\\-only. To modify the SSO configuration or remove this workspace from the SSO configuration, you must have access to the primary workspace. The name of the primary workspace can be found at the top of the **Identity \\& Provisioning** settings tab.\n\nWhy do I need to verify a domain to enable SSO?\n\nWe ask that the email domain ownership is validated to ensure that only the owner of the domain can customize how their users log into Notion.\n\nHaving trouble setting up SSO? Here are some common issues:\n\n* Try using a URL instead of an XML.\n* We recommend testing the setup process with a test account before enforcing it for users.\n* If neither of these options help, reach out to support at\n\nteam@makenotion.com\n.\n\nWhy should I remove email domains from the ‚ÄúAllowed Email Domains‚Äù setting before configuring SAML SSO for my workspace?\n\nThe ‚ÄúAllowed Email Domain‚Äù setting allows users with the selected domains to access your workspace without being provisioned via your IdP. To ensure that only users provisioned via your IdP can access your SAML\\-enabled workspace, disable this feature by removing all email addresses from the ‚ÄúAllowed Email Domain‚Äù list.\n\nCan I still log in to Notion if my identity provider is out of service?\n\nYes, even with SAML enforced, Workspace owners have the option to log in with email. Thereafter, a Workspace owner can change the SAML configuration to disable `Enforce SAML` so users may log in with email again.\n\nAre profile photos transmitted to Notion from the IdP?\n\nYes, profilePhoto is an optional custom attribute. You may assign this attribute to a corresponding attribute in your IdP, provided the attribute contains the URL to an image. If the profilePhoto field is set, this image will replace the avatar in Notion when the user signs in using SAML SSO.\n\nHow do I allow admins of other workspaces in my SAML configuration create new workspaces?\n\nOnly the admins of your primary workspace will be able to create new workspaces using your verified domain(s). Please reach out to our support team (team@makenotion.com) to switch your primary SAML workspace to another linked workspace in your SAML configuration.\n\nStill have more questions?\nMessage support',

What does this mean?\n\nIf the domain is displayed in yellow, that means it‚Äôs pending validation. You need to either complete the instructions to update the DNS record or click `Verify` in the Verification modal.\n\nI verified my domain in the past with the help of the Notion Support team. What will my workspace creation permissions be?\n\nIf you verified your domain before the functionality to customize permissions for workspace creation was supported, your setting will remain as `Anyone` can create a workspace using your verified domain(s).\n\nWhy would I want to verify more than one domain?\n\nIf you own multiple domains ‚Äì e.g. acme.com and example.com ‚Äì and you plan to use SAML SSO to manage users from these domains or customize their permissions to create new workspaces, you might want to verify multiple domains.\n\nWho is restricted from creating a workspace when the setting is Only Workspace Owners?\n\nUsers from your verified domain will be restricted from creating new workspaces. Only workspace owners of the workspace where the domains have been verified, will be able to create workspaces.\n\nWhat can workspace owners do with domain management?\n\nDomain management features help Workspace owners better control and secure their workspaces. You can\nconfigure SAML SSO\nfor your workspace, build Notion integrations using\nlink previews\n, and\ncontrol who can create workspaces\n(for Enterprise plans only).\n\nWhat is visible to workspace owners with domain management?\n\nOwners of a domain will be able to see a list of workspaces that were created using the corporate domain, including information such as the list of workspace owners, number of members, and created date. They will not be able to see the content within the workspace.\n\nWhat does it mean when a workspaces is in a pending state?\n\nOnce a domain claim request has been submitted, the workspace will remain in the pending state in the workspace view until the claim has been processed.\n\nWhy can‚Äôt I claim a single\\-member workspace? I don‚Äôt want to delete it or request an account switch.\n\nConsolidating workspaces to your primary workspace is coming soon. In the meantime, you can work with the workspace owner of the single\\-member workspace to move content in your primary workspace.\n\nWhy can‚Äôt I delete a multi\\-member workspace?\n\nDeleting a multi\\-member workspace is not supported in the domain management workspace view, but once you‚Äôve successfully claimed a multi\\-member workspace you can follow the instructions to permanently delete the workspace as the new, sole workspace owner.\n\nWhy can‚Äôt I claim ownership of a workspace when it‚Äôs eligible to be claimed?\n\nIf your claim request is not getting processed, it‚Äôs likely that the workspace you‚Äôre trying to claim is either:\n\n* In a delinquent state on payments\n* In the 14 day waiting period after a domain is newly verified\n\nCan I merge workspaces?\n\nConsolidating workspaces to your primary workspace is coming soon. In the meantime, you can claim workspaces and manually move content to a primary workspace.\n\nCan I see all workspaces created by someone from my organization?\n\nThe workspace view in your domain management settings will only show workspaces that are eligible for domain claim. Workspaces on the Enterprise Plan will not be included.\n\nWhy am I unable to delete this single\\-member workspace?\n\nWorkspaces may be ineligible for deletion if:\n\n* The workspace has an outstanding unpaid invoice.\n* The workspace is on a paid plan.\n\nWhat are the single and multi\\-member tabs in the workspace view?\n\nDomain Management functionality with Notion is based on the number of members in the workspace.\n\n* Single\\-member workspaces are eligible to either change ownership to a non\\-corporate account or delete.\n* Multi\\-member workspaces are eligible to claim.\n\nStill have more questions?\nMessage support',

    '## When can a workspace owner transfer content?\n\nWhen a user is deleted, deprovisioned, or leaves a workspace, they may leave behind private page content. This feature allows a workspace owner of an Enterprise Plan workspace to transfer this content to another, current user so it is easily recovered.\n\n**Note:** This process applies on a user‚Äôs *private content* after they have left a workspace. Content shared with a current workspace member will **not** be transferrable.\n\nA workspace owner is able to reassign the private content of a user who has recently left the workspace if:\n\n* The user is not currently part of the workspace (they have been deprovisioned).\n* The user had private pages.\n* The user‚Äôs private pages were not already reassigned to another user.\n* The user was part of the workspace fewer than 30 days ago.\n* The workspace is on an Enterprise Plan subscription.',
    "## Reassign content\n\n1. Visit your `Settings & members` and click the `Members` section.\n2. Navigate to the `Recently left` users tab.\n3. For the user who has been deprovisioned (the ‚Äúrecently left user‚Äù), select the destination where you would like to send the deprovisioned user‚Äôs private pages.\n4. You will see a confirmation modal; select `Transfer private pages` to continue the private page transfer process.\n5. All of the deprovisioned user's private pages will appear in the destination user‚Äôs sidebar, nested under a new top\\-level private page.\n\n**Note:** A user who has had all their private pages reassigned will no longer be visible in the `Recently left` list.",
    "## Restore a user's content and access\n\nIf a user has left and rejoined a workspace within the last 30 days, workspace owners will be able to restore their private pages, shared pages, group membership, and teamspace membership.\n\nTo do this, simply add a member back to your workspace and their content and access will be automatically restored once they rejoin.",

    "## Configuring Notion for HIPAA\n\n| HIPAA Technical Safeguard Requirements | **Notion's Supporting Configurations** |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Access Control**    Implement technical policies and procedures for electronic information systems that maintain electronic protected health information to allow access only to those persons or software programs that have been granted access rights. | Notion‚Äôs SAML SSO is built upon the SAML 2\\.0 standard, connecting your Identity Provider (IdP) and workspace(s) for an easier, more secure login experience. Notion supports official configurations for SAML SSO with: Azure, Google, Gusto, Okta, OneLogin, and Rippling.     **To get started using SAML SSO with Notion, you'll need to complete the following steps:**      **Verify domain(s):** To use advanced security features, you must verify ownership of your email domain. This is an automated process that involves adding a TXT record onto your domain‚Äôs DNS to verify your ownership of it.     **Enable SAML SSO:** This will toggle the feature on and complete the configuration. For more information on completing the SAML SSO configuration, please refer to  this article .     **Change default login method:** Once SAML SSO is enabled for the first time, the default login method will be set to\xa0`Any method`, meaning that users have the option of logging in via SAML or their normal login method. By setting this to `Only SAML SSO`, this enforces SAML as the login method for your workspace for managed users with verified company emails.    **Link additional workspaces:** If you have more than one workspace you‚Äôd like to configure with SSO, you can do so by reaching out to\xa0 team@makenotion.com .    Once properly configured, any members signing into your workspace(s) will need to use the verified domain and will need to be authenticated through your identity provider. Enterprise workspace owners are able to bypass by using an alternative login method in case there‚Äôs an IdP/SAML SSO failure. |\n| **Unique User Identification**    Assign a unique name and/or number for identifying and tracking user identity. | Notion has a SCIM API which can be used to provision, manage, and de\\-provision members and groups. Workspace owners can find the required API key by going to `Settings` ‚Üí `Security & identity` ‚Üí `SCIM Configuration` and clicking to view the token. Please see  our SCIM documentation  for the latest information on how you can interact with Notion‚Äôs SCIM API. Notion supports official SCIM applications with Google, Gusto, Okta, OneLogin, and Rippling. |\n| **Emergency Access Procedure**    Establish (and implement as needed) procedures for obtaining necessary electronic protected health information during an emergency. | Content search provides Enterprise workspace owners with visibility into workspace content to improve governance of the workspace and resolve page access issues. Content search allows you to: ‚Ä¢ View who has access to a page‚Ä¢ Modify the permissions of a page‚Ä¢ Discover and re\\-assign abandoned pages from former employees You can export a Notion page, database, or entire workspace at any time. |\n| **Automatic Logoff**    Implement electronic procedures that terminate an electronic session after a predetermined time of inactivity. | **Set custom session duration:** For managed users on the Enterprise Plan, Notion has a default session duration of 180 days. However, workspace owners can customize their session duration from 1 hour to 180 days.  **Force logout managed users:** Force logout for individual users or for all workspace users at once.   **Force password reset:** Force password reset for individual users or for all workspace users at once. If you de\\-provision a user via SCIM, they will be removed from the workspace and their session will be terminated. |\n| **Audit Controls**    Implement hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that record and examine activity in information systems that contain or use electronic protected health information. | Enterprise workspace owners have access to an Audit Log via\xa0`Settings`. This gives an overview of a large range of events that have occurred in the workspace.   This can be especially helpful for identifying potential security issues, investigating suspicious behavior, and troubleshooting access. The workspace audit log can be exported in CSV format.   Enterprise customers can also utilize our  Data Loss Prevention (DLP) partner integrations  to discover, classify, and protect sensitive data in Notion. |\n| **Integrity Controls**    Implement policies and procedures to protect electronic protected health information from improper alteration or destruction. Implement electronic mechanisms to corroborate that electronic protected health information has not been altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner. Implement security measures to ensure that electronically transmitted electronic protected health information is not improperly modified without detection until disposed of. | **Disable public page sharing:** This will disable the Share to web option in the Share menu on every page in this workspace.  **Disable guests:** This prevents anyone from inviting people outside the workspace to any page. You don‚Äôt need to use this control if you‚Äôd like to invite guests as needed, but note that Notion may not be used to communicate with patients, plan members, or their families and employers. If you need to enable guests, we recommend turning on  guest requests . This implements an approval process so that you can have guests in your workspace while ensuring HIPAA compliance.  **Disable moving or duplicating pages to other workspaces:** This prevents anyone from moving or duplicating pages to other workspaces via the Move To or Duplicate action.  **Disable export:** This prevents anyone from exporting as Markdown, CSV, or PDF.  **Disable workspace creation:** This prevents anyone from creating new workspace(s) without approval.  **Disable or allowlist third party extensions:** This prevents anyone from adding non\\-approved 3rd party extensions to your Notion workspace.  **Disable external workspace access:** This prevents managed users from joining or accessing external workspace outside of your organization. |\n| **Person or Entity Authentication**    Implement procedures to verify that a person or entity seeking access to electronic protected health information is the one claimed. | **Disable profile changes:** This prevents managed users from changing their own profile information to avoid impersonations.  **Domain management:** Domain refers to the email address domain associated with a Notion account. Domain verification allows workspace owners to claim ownership over a domain, which will unlock domain management settings.  **Disable guests:** This prevents anyone from inviting people outside the workspace to any page. You don‚Äôt need to use this control if you‚Äôd like to invite guests as needed, but note that Notion may not be used to communicate with patients, plan members, or their families and employers. If you need to enable guests, we recommend turning on  guest requests . This implements an approval process so that you can have guests in your workspace while ensuring HIPAA compliance.  **Suspend or delete a managed user account:** Suspend or delete managed user accounts from the user management dashboard.  **Disable managed user account deletion:** Prevent managed users from deleting their accounts on their own. |\n| **Data Retention \\& Disposal**    Implement policies and procedures to address the final disposition of electronic PHI and/or the hardware or electronic media on which it is stored. | Custom data retention settings  allow Enterprise workspace owners to have control over when users‚Äô pages are deleted from Trash, and how long they can be retained for afterwards.   We keep backups of our database, which allows us to restore a snapshot of your content in the past 30 days if you need it. |\n| **Transmission Security**    Implement technical security measures to guard against unauthorizedaccess to electronic protected health information that is being transmitted over an electronic communications network. Implement a mechanism to encrypt electronic protected health information whenever deemed appropriate. | **Encryption at rest:** Customer data is encrypted at rest using AES\\-256\\. Customer data is encrypted when on Notion‚Äôs internal networks, at rest in Cloud storage, database tables, and backups.  **Encryption in transit:** Data sent in\\-transit is encrypted using TLS 1\\.2 or greater. |\n\n**Note:** Enterprise workspace owners are able to bypass by using an alternative login method in case there‚Äôs an IdP/SAML SSO failure.",

In the case where a guest user is given full Slack workspace member and full Notion workspace member permissions, Notion AI monitor for membership changes and updates those permissions changes in near\\-real time.\n* When a user is deactivated in Slack, Notion AI monitors permissions and updates that permission change within approximately 30 minutes.\n\n**I have Slack Connect channels set up with external users. Will these channels be indexed?**\n\nNo. All external messages and channels will be excluded.\n\n**How does Notion store or reference my Slack data in its systems?**\n\nSlack content is stored as embeddings using vector databases like Pinecone. These embeddings allow for efficient searches and comparisons across different pieces of text to provide accurate and relevant responses to your questions.\n\nNotion‚Äôs vector databases have been vetted by our Security team as well as by an external auditor to obtain their SOC2 Type II certification. See\nthis article\nfor more information.\n\n**How much of my Slack data will be ingested for Notion AI?**\n\nOnce the integration is set up, it will be able to find messages going back a year from when the setup is complete. For example, if you connect Slack with Notion AI on June 1, 2024, Notion AI will be able to find information from messages in Slack sent on June 1, 2023 and later. The feature will also continue to ingest any new messages added to your Slack environment (in either your selected channels or all public channels) after initial configuration to be used for responses to search queries.\n\n**I connected the wrong Notion workspace. How can I disconnect my Slack workspace from Notion?**\n\nTo disconnect your Slack workspace, open Notion AI at the bottom of your screen and click on `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢` ‚Üí `Connect Slack` ‚Üí `Settings` ‚Üí `Disconnect`.\n\n**What happens to my Slack data if I connect to Notion AI and then decide to disconnect?**\n\nNotion treats your Slack content with the privacy principle of data minimization in mind.

For additional information, please see our\nData Processing Addendum\n.',
    '### How does Notion AI use content from a workspace?\n\nNotion AI is able to reference content from your workspace through two key phases:\n\n1. Generating an embedding (i.e., a semantic representation of the information stored in your workspace).\n2. Generating responses informed by the content in your workspace.\n\n**What are embeddings?**\n\nEmbeddings are numerical representations of text or documents. These representations capture the meaning and context of the text in a multidimensional space, where similar topics have similar numerical representations. By using embeddings, vector search algorithms can efficiently compare and find similarities between different pieces of text or documents. For Notion AI, embeddings are created from workspace content to enable the system to provide accurate and relevant responses to user questions.\n\nHere is an example of an embedding from\nOpenAI\n:\n\n`[\n-0.02541878,\n-0.0104167685,\n-0.0015037002,\n...,\n-0.004155378,\n-0.00043069973,\n-0.01679479\n]`\n\n**How are embeddings created?**\n\n1. For each page in your workspace, we generate an embedding by using an OpenAI zero\\-retention embeddings API.\n2. Notion receives an embedding for each Notion page and stores it in a vector database (e.g., Pinecone). The vector database is a data store optimized for embeddings that enables fast lookup of the most relevant pages given a user request.\n\n**How are embeddings protected?**\n\nDespite embeddings only being a numerical representation of Customer Data, Notion still treats embeddings with the same level of security and privacy considerations as Customer Data. All our Customer Data commitments outlined in our Master Service Agreement (MSA) and Data Processing Agreement (DPA) apply to embeddings. View our\nTerms and Privacy Page\nfor more information.\n\nWe store embeddings with vector databases like Pinecone. These vector databases have been vetted by our security team as well as an external auditor to obtain their SOC 2 Type 2 certification.',
    '### How are responses generated?\n\n1. Notion receives a request from a user.\n2. The request is passed to LLMs and AI Models. If the request does not require searching the Notion workspace, a response is generated at this point and returned. If the user‚Äôs request requires searching their workspace, LLMs and AI Models generate a search query most relevant for the user request.\n3. The query is passed to a vector database, where a list of pages is found based on relevance to that query.\n4. Notion sends the query ‚Äî and the pages identified by the vector database ‚Äî to LLMs and AI Models where the pages are refined and ranked by relevance to the query.\n5. The query, refined list of pages, and ranking of pages are processed by the LLMs and AI Models to generate a response that fulfills the user‚Äôs request.\n6. Notion processes the output to adhere to the right format and language and displays the output to the user.',
    '## How is my data protected?\n\n### Does Notion AI respect existing permissions?\n\nYes, Notion AI honors existing permissions. The LLMs and AI Models used to generate AI responses for a user cannot see or use any information to which that user does not already have access.',
    '### How is Customer Data protected when sent to AI Subprocessors?\n\nNotion AI is designed to protect your Customer Data and prevent information leaks to other users of the service.\n\nPrior to engaging any third\\-party Subprocessor or vendor, Notion evaluates their privacy, security, and confidentiality practices, and executes an agreement implementing its applicable security, privacy, and legal obligations. All Subprocessors are monitored and reviewed at least annually to ensure continued compliance with Notion‚Äôs security and privacy expectations. This includes reviewing documents such as attestation reports, penetration tests, and other artifacts based on the Subprocessor‚Äôs criticality and other risk factors. As part of the onboarding and ongoing reviews, technology security questionnaires are distributed to vendors and are required to be completed. Significant public security events are also assessed to protect the supply chain attack surface.\n\nWhen we send your Customer Data to third parties, it is encrypted in\\-transit using TLS 1\\.2 or greater.\n\nFor more information about how Notion processes your data, please refer to our\nData Processing Addendum\n.',
    '### Will my data be used to train any models?\n\nBy default, Notion and its AI Subprocessors do not use Customer Data to train any models. We specifically have contractual agreements in place with our AI Subprocessors that prohibit the use of Customer Data to train their models.\n\nYour use of Notion AI does not grant Notion any right or license to your Customer Data to train our machine learning models.\n\n### How is Customer Data segregated?\n\nIndividual customer accounts are kept separate in our production environment. We do not mix or process data from different customers together during AI processing. This means we do not expose your data to other Notion customers.',
    "### What are the data retention obligations of third\\-party AI providers?\n\nNotion AI\nSubprocessors\nhave data retention policies that allow Notion to meet\nour obligations to customers for the processing of data\n.\n\nWhen using Notion AI, our LLM providers utilize zero data retention for Enterprise plan workspaces, so no data is stored with LLM providers. For all non\\-Enterprise plan workspaces, LLM providers only retain Customer Data for 30 days or fewer before deletion. Notion AI is additionally powered by OpenAI's embeddings. OpenAI does not retain any Customer Data through their embeddings service.\n\nEmbeddings stored in vector databases are deleted within 60 days from when the page or workspace is deleted.\n\nIf a user deletes a Notion page or Notion workspace, we can restore the content within 30 days. After 30 days, the data is deleted and unrecoverable. This includes any AI\\-generated data and embeddings. For more information about deleting or restoring your data, please refer to\nthis article\n.",
    '### What compliance standards does Notion AI meet?\n\nNotion AI is included in the scope of Notion‚Äôs SOC 2 Type 2 report and ISO 27001 certification, demonstrating our commitment to various regulatory and industry standards.\n\nNotion AI enables HIPAA compliance by utilizing LLM provider‚Äôs zero\\-retention APIs and allows for the processing of protected health information (PHI).\n\n## What controls can be added?',
    '### Can data loss prevention (DLP) be configured to alert for data being used by Notion AI?\n\nCustomers can trigger data loss prevention (DLP) alerts for sensitive content in their Notion workspace using third\\-party integration partners on our Enterprise Plan. That will include content in an AI prompt and the content generated by AI. Learn more about our DLP integrations\nhere\n.\n\n## What are the legal considerations?',
    '### Are there rules against what I can do with Notion AI?\n\nThe\nNotion AI Supplementary Terms\napply to your usage of Notion AI. In addition, Notion‚Äôs\nContent \\& Use Policy\napplies to any content on Notion, including content generated by Notion AI. Violating these terms can result in removal of your content or suspension of access to your workspace.',
    '### Who owns the rights to content generated by Notion AI?\n\nNotion does not claim ownership of your input or the generated output. This is addressed in the\nNotion AI Supplementary Terms\nin the "Input and Output" section:\n\n> You may provide input to be processed by Notion AI (‚ÄúInput‚Äù), and receive output generated and returned by Notion AI based on the Input (‚ÄúOutput‚Äù). When you use Notion AI, Input and Output are your Customer Data.\n\nYou can also reference our standard\ndata protection practices\n.',

Select `Share availability` in your right context panel, or use the keyboard shortcut `S`.\n2. Select preferred time slots in your calendar.\n3. In the right context panel, toggle on `Allow multiple bookings` to keep your availability and scheduling link active for more bookings, as long as one or more of your time slots remains open. This means multiple people can use the same scheduling link to book time with you.\n4. If you have multiple calendars in Notion Calendar, make sure you‚Äôre creating your availability for your desired calendar. You can change your calendar by clicking on your calendar name under `Allow multiple bookings`.\n5. By default, `Avoid conflicts` will be toggled on.

Choose to `Include details` from the original calendar event in the block, or simply `Show as busy`. This will apply to future blocks if you choose to auto\\-block.\n\nIf you manage your time across two calendars, like work and personal, use event blocking to automatically block time on each.\n\nTo see what details you‚Äôve shared on a calendar block, right\\-click the original event and select Block on calendar. There will be a `üîí`\xa0next to the calendar where the block was set up ‚Äî if the lock is open, that means the event‚Äôs details have been shared.

    '## Conferencing integrations\n\nFor the best experience with setting up conferencing integrations and adding conferencing links to events, use Notion Calendar on desktop or web.\n\nNotion Calendar integrates with conferencing tools like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and many more. There are three types of conferencing integrations in Notion Calendar:\n\n* Default integrations: Conferencing that is available to you by default from your calendar provider. Google Meet, which is linked to Google Calendar, is one example.\n* Connected integrations: An integration you can set up by logging into a conferencing tool. New events you create on desktop or web will generate new links for this conference tool from within Notion Calendar. Zoom is an example of a connected integration that Notion Calendar supports.\n* Custom integrations: You can add a stable conferencing link for a conferencing tool of your choice by going to `Settings` ‚Üí `Conferencing` ‚Üí `Conferencing providers` ‚Üí `Add`. You can give your integration a name. This conferencing tool will show up in the conferencing dropdown when you create events. Any stable links will work, but Notion Calendar can detect popular services, including\nAround\n,\nBlueJeans\n,\nDoxy.me\n,\nMicrosoft Teams\n,\nSkype\n,\nWebex\n, and\nWhereby\n.\n\n**Note:** If an event contains conferencing links in both its description and conferencing field, you‚Äôll be taken to the link from the event‚Äôs description when you join a meeting from Notion Calendar.',
    '### Set a default conferencing option\n\nA default conferencing option allows you to automatically add conferencing to an event that has at least one other participant when you‚Äôre using Notion Calendar on desktop. To set Zoom as this default option, go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Conferencing` ‚Üí `Default conferencing`, then in the dropdown, select `Zoom`.',
    "### Zoom\n\n**Connect your Zoom account**\n\nTo connect your Zoom and Notion Calendar accounts, go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Conferencing`. Find `Zoom` and select `Configure`. When you‚Äôre redirected to your browser, make sure you‚Äôre logged in with the right Zoom account, then select `Authorize` to give Notion Calendar access.\n\nNotion Calendar asks only for the\nZoom permissions\nthat we absolutely need to make sure the integration with Notion Calendar works properly. These permissions are only used to allow you to connect your account and add Zoom meetings to events.\nLearn more about our security practices here ‚Üí\n\n**Passcode settings**\n\nIf you‚Äôve enabled the use of Personal Meeting IDs (PMIs) in your\nZoom Profile Settings\n, Notion Calendar will use your configured stable PMI and passcode when adding a Zoom link to a meeting. If this setting is off in Zoom, Notion Calendar will protect your Zoom calls with a secure, one\\-time PIN and include it in the meeting for you and participants to join with a single click. Notion Calendar generates these PINs according to your Zoom admin's\npasscode complexity requirements\n.\n\n**Disconnect your Zoom account**\n\nTo stop using your Zoom account with Notion Calendar, go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Conferencing`. Find Zoom and select `Disconnect`.\n\nIf you remove Notion Calendar from your installed apps in Zoom App Marketplace, we will follow Zoom's\ndeauthorization and data compliance\nguidelines.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* If you‚Äôre having trouble authorizing Notion Calendar as you set up the integration, have an admin sign into\nmarketplace.zoom.us\n, search for Notion Calendar, and turn on `Pre-approve`.\n* Currently, when you join a meeting in the Zoom app from Notion Calendar, your video will be turned off by default.\n* If you have any problems joining a meeting, try disconnecting then reconnecting your Zoom account.",
    '### Google Meet\n\nBecause Notion Calendar is already connected to your Google account, you don‚Äôt need to do anything else to add Google Meet links to your meetings! Even if you‚Äôve connected multiple Google accounts to Notion Calendar, Notion Calendar will make sure you‚Äôre joining meetings across your various calendars from the right Google account.\n\n**Note:** If you don‚Äôt see Google Meet as a conferencing option in Notion Calendar, it might mean your Google Workspace doesn‚Äôt have Google Meet enabled. Reach out to an admin to\nturn on Meet video calling\n.',

You\'ll need to share the new link. To find the new link, open the published page in Notion and select `Share` at the top ‚Üí `Publish`. Find the URL at the top and select `üîó` next to it to copy it.\n\nI shared my public page URL but it takes people to a page with a "Continue to external site by following the link below" error message. What did I do wrong?\n\nMake sure you‚Äôve shared the link to the published page, and not the version of the page in your Notion workspace! The link should begin with your Notion workspace domain name. To find it, open the published page in Notion and select `Share` at the top ‚Üí `Publish`. Find the URL at the top and select `üîó` next to it to copy it.\n\nCan I password protect a page?\n\nUnfortunately, not at the moment.
